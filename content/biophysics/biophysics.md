>Biophysics is much more than biology + physics. It’s in fact the confluence of several
scientific disciplines: physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, statistics, computer
modelling, and engineering – all are integrated to solve some of nature’s big problems.
Personally, I like to put a stronger emphasis on physics (otherwise my physics colleagues
tend to erroneously think I’m doing biology). This would be my definition: Biophysics is
the branch of physics that applies the methods and theories of physics to study
biological systems. In short, biophysicists study the physics of living systems. 

– Prof. Tjaart Krüger, Head of the Biophysics Research Group.

Biophysics is a vibrant, interdisciplinary field that brings together scientists from
fields such as physics, biology, chemistry, maths, and material science to share their
skills and develop new tools for understanding how biology works.

Biology primarily focuses on the variety and complexity of living systems, while physics
looks at the fundamental laws of nature and makes detailed predictions about the effects
of these laws on the physical world. Biological systems are highly complex with many
competing and co-existing reactions at room temperature. Physics is usually best studied
in simple, well-controlled ideal circumstances because this is where mathematics can be
applied to explain what is happening in the system. Much of what is left to discover in
biological systems will be found at the most fundamental level of life. Experimental and
computational physics are the most powerful ways to learn about these systems. Herein
lies the challenge of biophysics. It is the bridge between highly disordered and complex
biological systems and the simplicity and beauty of the laws of nature. It is the role of
a biophysicist to apply the principles and methods of physics to biological systems.

Biophysicists study life at every level, from the molecular level up to entire
ecosystems. They develop new experimental and computational methods to understand all
aspects of biological systems at a fundamental level, solving scientific mysteries in the
process. Biophysicists push the scientific envelope to answer questions that have
remained unanswered and solve the problems of the future. 

The structure, function, and dynamics of biological systems can often be visualised using
electromagnetic radiation. Some other interesting properties include conductivity and
binding energy, which can only be described using physical methods. Much of experimental
biophysics is devoted to developing methods that provide accurate and reliable results of
nanoscale machines without damaging these delicate systems. Technological developments in
the last two decades have allowed for multiscale imaging from cellular to atomic
resolution, as well as recording events on ultrafast (picoseconds to femtosecond)
timescales.

Biophysics has applications in a broad range of fields, from computer modelling to
neuroscience to agriculture and medical applications. The questions that interest
biophysicists are as diverse as the organisms they study. Some examples include:

- How do plants use sunlight to make food?
- How can we modify micro-organisms to produce bioelectricity?
- How do nature's nano-machines (like motor proteins and enzymes) move to do their work?
- How does the brain process and store information?
- How are genes switched on and off?

Biophysics is a fountain of innovation. Society is facing many global physical and
biological challenges. How will we create enough energy to sustain a growing population?
How can we feed that growing population? How do we preserve biological diversity? How do
we repair and remediate global warming? Biophysics provides valuable insight into these
challenges and equips scientists to develop potential solutions.
