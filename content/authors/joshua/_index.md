I am investigating how energy is transferred within and between photosynthetic proteins
by using different spectroscopic techniques such as single molecule spectroscopy and
fluorescence streak camera measurements. Iâ€™m also the main developer of the single
molecule spectroscopy experiment that has been built at the University of Pretoria.
Biophysics offers a platform to study fascinating processes using tools from a vast range
of different fields of science. Multidisciplinary scientific endeavours, such as these, I
believe is the way forward; working together to explore and develop exciting new avenues
of science.
