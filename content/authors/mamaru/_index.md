My research focuses on employing quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM)
approaches to study the photochemistry of a pigment in phycobiliproteins. Modeling the
charge transfer states in phycocyanobilins will help us to understand the molecular
mechanisms used by organisms in response to a sudden increase in light intensity.
Exploring the origin of far-red emission states using electronic structure methods will
be used in the design of artificial light-harvesting materials. I am also interested in
the role of metals in medicine. I enjoy designing and synthesis of coordination compounds
of different metal center for antioxidant and anticancer activities where computational
chemistry play great role from ligand screening to quantum chemical computation.
