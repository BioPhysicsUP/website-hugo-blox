There are multiple ways of tracking a single molecule/particle using light. At present, a
few of these techniques require the tracked molecule to have a fluorescence mechanism,
but this limits the set of particles that can be tracked as not all single molecules
fluoresce. A technique not limited by this requirement is interferometric scattering,
iSCAT. Depending only on the particle in questionâ€™s ability to scatter light, this
technique broadens the set of particles that can be studied. This technique is not
without its own limits. One of which is the immense problem that signal noise presents.
Machine learning and other modeling processes will be used to develop a iSCAT set-up that
can do single particle tracking in real time over three dimensions.
