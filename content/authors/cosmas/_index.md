At the heart of photosynthesis is the remarkable efficiency of the energy-capturing
phase, coupled with the ability of photosynthetic organisms to dissipate harmful excess
energy through specialized mechanisms. Understanding these processes is crucial for
designing efficient solar cells that mimic these natural conditions. My research focuses
on investigating methods to accurately model natural systems by developing a quantum
mechanical understanding of such processes. Central to our efforts is the calculation of
an accurate Hamiltonian, as the success of the model hinges on accurately representing
the Hamiltonian of natural systems. Recent advancements in the field have seen a surge in
the application of bioinformatics and chem-informatics to support this endeavor. Our
group is enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute significantly to this field.

The experimental methods used by our group involve the use of laser beams which tend to
have problems with aberrations. Hence I am also developing deeper analytic and
semi-analytic models for laser beams carrying aberrations which we express using Zernike
polynomials. This will help us develop novel methods for effective adaptive control and
elimination of aberrations.
