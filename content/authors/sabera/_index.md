I am exploring the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the photoprotection mechanism
via NPQ using single molecule spectroscopy (SMS) along with other spectroscopic and
electroanalytical techniques. The research findings help to figure out ways to intensify
photosynthetic capacity and crop productivity. Additionally, my focus extends to examining
the effects of SMALP polymers on light harvesting complexes at the single-molecule level.
