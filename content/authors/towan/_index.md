During the process of photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by pigment molecules that
are embedded in protein complexes called light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). In plants,
the LHCs, in turn, form part of two photosystems (called PSI and PSII). My research
project focuses on understanding the energy flow and regulation, after photon absorption,
in PSI, and in three separable LHCs (called CP29, CP24, and CP26) of the more complex
PSII. I approach my research using a combination of experimental techniques and computer
simulation. I enjoy setting up models to simulate molecular energy transfer events, as
this process requires one to think critically in order to gain a fundamental
understanding of our complex, beautiful world. Biophysics offers the best of two
fields: the complex beauty of Biology and the rigour of Physics.
