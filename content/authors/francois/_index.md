The abilities of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) to respond to
environmental stressors, like high light intensities, acidity, or temperature
fluctuations, are very promising for advances in energy security, biosensing, and even
quantum computation. My research focus is the fluorescence photon statistics of LHCs and
the comparison of their quantum optical properties to that of semiconductor quantum dots
(QDs). My approach is to combine several spectroscopic techniques, like fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC),
towards unveiling sub-nanosecond photophysical processes in LHCs and QDs. Incorporation
of plasmonic gold nanoparticles to enhance the fluorescence of LHCs and QDs is intended
to achieve multi-picosecond time-resolution and for developing quantum biosensing
capabilities.
