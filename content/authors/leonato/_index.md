Photosynthesis, an indispensable process, is the most important biological process on
earth. By liberating oxygen and consuming carbon dioxide, it has transformed the world
into the hospitable environment we have today. The light-harvesting protein complexes of
photosynthetic organisms are intriguing molecular machines. They use the principles of
quantum mechanics and switch between light-harvesting and photoprotective functions. The
photoprotective state is established through a complex mechanism known as
non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) during which excitation energy is thermally dissipated
in a clean and safe manner. Since the photosynthetic light-harvesting process is
dominated by the laws of quantum mechanics, precise control of the switch between
light-harvesting and NPQ demands a technique based on quantum control; an approach that
has not yet been utilised. In this light, I am using laser coherent control to observe
and actively manipulate the course of physical and chemical processes immediately after
photoexcitation of LHCII, the main light-harvesting complex of plants. Through the
wavefront shaping of ultrashort laser pulses under the instruction of a genetic
algorithm, the quenching process can be optimised or minimised. The 4f setup, which forms
part of an ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy setup, contains a Spatial Light
Modulator (SLM), which will be used for shaping the pump pulse in phase and amplitude,
while a genetic algorithm will be implemented to manipulate the laser pulses until an
optimal pulse shape is achieved. At the end of this interesting adventure, we believe
that the results obtained will be able to guide agricultural biotechnologies to develop
high-light tolerant crops through genetic modification. Finally, with the advent of
Biomimicry, a perfect understanding of the fundamental properties of these intriguing
molecular machines (like LHCII), will serve as a great inspiration for finding green,
sustainable energy solutions for our planet.
